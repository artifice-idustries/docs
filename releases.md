## Versioning Scheme

Stamp's versioning scheme maintains the following convention: `paradigm.major.minor`. Major releases are released every six months (March and September), while minor releases may be released as often as every week. Minor releases should **never** contain breaking changes.

Paradigm shifting releases are separated by many years and represent fundamental shifts in the applications architecture and conventions. Currently, there is no paradigm shifting release in development for `Stamp on macOS`.
