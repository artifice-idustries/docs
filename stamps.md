## Introduction

A Stamp is a mark in time when an activity happened. There are a variety of different types of stamps and each one will have a timestamp which denotes where it sits in real time. Depending on the type, different properties of information will be stored as well. For example a Note Stamp will store a block of text. A Flag Stamp stores the reference to a media file, its properties, as well as a block of text for a title or description.
