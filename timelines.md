## Introduction

Stamp is a document based application. Each Stamp document revolves around a single timeline that spans endlessly forwards and backwards in real time. As stamps are created they will automatically be ordered in relation to their timestamp. The timeline can be scrolled from top to bottom, oldest to newest respectively.
