# Workflow

Stamp is designed to help you create rich designs by understanding the intricate details of a live production. To give you an idea of the possibilities, the overall process of logging a live production or analysing a recorded production with Stamp is described below.

## Connect everything up
The first step to logging a production, is to open Stamp, select a video camera to record from and connect Stamp with as many devices and applications that are being used to create your production as possible. In Stamp, you can log events from all kinds of things, using well known, industry standard protocols.

## Start recording and make notes
About to run a complicated scene change or run a rehearsal performance, document the important events that occur throughout by hitting record. With stamp, you can make notes inline with the recording. Each note is stamped onto the same timeline as the recorded media, giving you a clear context for where your note sits within the production and its relationship with the surrounding logged events.

## Save and share the timeline
