## Introduction

A connection is the relationship that allows Stamp to log a specific activity by an application or device. A connection may be either physical or virtual in reality and not always bidirectional in communication but should in all instances be thought of as the route between the device or application and Stamp. When disconnecting a connection your are effectively severing the link and stopping the logging.
